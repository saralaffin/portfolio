This is my first time building a project with Vue and I appreciated the similar concepts to React.

The nav bar gave me a lot of grief, and the tracking function only works on desktop versions.

And of course the content and layout are always a WIP, but that is me!

Thank you for stopping by and I'd love to hear your feedback.
